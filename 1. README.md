# Short-Python-Exercises
**Quick and basic Python**

These are Python exercises completed in class around July 2021
(except, admittedly, the Rock Paper and Scissors game and the temperature conversion program, which I updated more recently (September))

**List of contents**

1. BullsAndCows
   - A traditional game where the computer selects a random 4 digit number (no repeats), and the player must try and guess this number. Guess a digit in the correct 'place' and that's a Bull. Guess a correct number, but in the wrong place, you've got yourself a cow. e.g. Com: 1234 | You: 1624 = 2 Bulls (1, 4), 1 Cow (2). Of course, in the real game, you're not told which numbers are cows and which are bulls ;)  
 
3. CaseCount
   - A program that counts the number of upper and lower case letters in a string the user has inputted
   
2. ConvertTemperatures
   - Allows you to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, and vice versa
   
3. EveryDigitEven
   - Prints out every number within range 100-400 incl., where each digit of the number is even
   
5. FizzBuzz
   - You know what FizzBuzz is
   
7. GuessTheNumber
   - COM guesses a number between 1-9 randomly; player must guess the number within 5 tries
   
9. IsItPrime
   - User inputs a number: computer tells user if it is *in fact*(!) a prime number. Writing this one kicked my ass hard at the time, I'm not sure why? Wild.
   
11. MaxofThree
    - User inputs three separate numbers and Python picks out the biggest number!

13. MeatCooker
    - User inputs the type of meat they wish to cook (from a choice of 4 meats), along with the meat's weight in kg. The program then tells you how long the meat should be cooked for!* (I just repeated the word "meat" so much, it doesn't mean anything anymore. Meat.)

14. PasswordGenerator
    - Generate a random password as needed: set the number of letters, numbers and special characters you wish!
    
15. RangeExercises
    - Exercises making use of Python's range() function; pretty basic!
    
17. ReverseUserString
    - Takes a string from the user and reverses the word order of that string
    
19. RockPaperScissors
    - You know what this is :-)

20. TipCalculator
    - Calculate how much each person in your group should pay towards an evenly split bill; staff tip included.
